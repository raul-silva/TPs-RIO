# TPs-RIO
This is a repository to all codes implemented on practical sessions of RIO (RÃ©seaux mobiles et Internet des Objets).

Most of the codes were written on Matlab, but they can also be opened and turned on Octave, an open source quite similar to Matlab.
Most of codes were entirely written by me.
